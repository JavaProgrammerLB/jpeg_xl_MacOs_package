# jpeg_xl_MacOs_package
- [JPEG XL](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl) is a new image coding standard with many useful feature

- I am failed to install **cjxl** with command `brew install jpeg_xl` in my Macbook

- There is no [release](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/releases/tag/v0.11.1) for my macbook to install the software

- I create this repository to package **x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz** and **aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz** for libjxl
